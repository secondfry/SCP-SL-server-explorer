    <h1>Source code and dance around Adaptation and Collection</h1>
    <p>How would one judge if something is adaptation of the work or part of the collection of separate works? It is a vague topic really.</p>
    <p>What we can agree upon is that, from eyes of random observer, SCP behaviour and image in the game is unseparatable from concept of SCP. That would make actor scripts part of derivate work which would then fall into CC BY-SA 3.0 domain.</p>
    <h1>What now?</h1>
    <p>Previously SCP:SL EULA was unclear on some quite important topics.<br>August 16, 2018 it has been reworked into much more permissive and clearer written one.</p>
    <p>Situation around SCP:SL being derivative work or not has been reported to SCP Foundation <a href="http://05command.wikidot.com/license-experts-main">Licensing Team</a>.<br>Apparently they were already aware of the problem.</p>
    <p>Hopefully SCP:SL EULA will change again into even more permissive one. For now, all we can do is spread the word and discuss the issue.</p>
